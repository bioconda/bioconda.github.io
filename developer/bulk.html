<h1>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> branch<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bulk-branch" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to do maintenance or make changes to lots of recipes at once.
This happens most often when there is a new Bioconductor release: all
<code class="xref any docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconductor-*</span></code> recipes need to be updated, and the corresponding packages
need to be built.</p>
<p>This ends up taking substantial compute time on CI infrastructure. If this were
run on the same CI infrastructure that processes pull requests, this might
consume CI time needed for the typical functioning of the daily activity in the
bioconda repository. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> branch is a mechanism for the Bioconda core
team to perform large-scale changes on a different CI system, without tying up
the CI infrastructure used by contributors on individual pull requests.</p>
<p>The bulk branch reads its configuration (which version of bioconda-utils and
miniconda) from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> branch of <code class="xref any docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-common</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>The bulk branch immediately uploads successfully built packages to
Anaconda.</strong> As such, only the bioconda core team has the ability to push to
this branch.</p>
<section id="interacting-with-the-bulk-branch">
<h2>Interacting with the bulk branch<a class="headerlink" href="#interacting-with-the-bulk-branch" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When changes are made on the bulk branch (committed and pushed), the CI system
decides whether it will run its jobs or not.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If any of the pushed commit messages contains the substring <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[ci</span> <span class="pre">run]</span></code> the CI jobs are executed.</p></li>
<li><p>If not, no CI jobs are executed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that we want to avoid race conditions caused by multiple CI jobs
spawned from different commits to be exectuted at the same time.</p>
<p>In order to simplify interactions with the bulk CI, bioconda-utils offers therefore
some dedicated subcommands:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>bulk-commit</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-utils</span> <span class="pre">bulk-commit</span> <span class="pre">&lt;message&gt;</span></code> commits the changes on your
local clone of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes">https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes</a> to the bulk branch while marking the commit
as being eligible for a CI run (by automatically prefixing the message with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[ci</span> <span class="pre">run]</span></code>).
The <strong>bulk-commit</strong> subcommand does not push the commit. This enables you to do multiple fine-grained commits
and push them in one pass via a subsequent <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> that triggers a single CI run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bulk-trigger-ci</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-utils</span> <span class="pre">bulk-trigger-ci</span></code> creates an empty commit that is
immediately pushed automatically to the bulk branch, thereby triggering a CI run. This can be used
to restart the CI run in case all of the previous runs are finished without build failures but there
are still packages that need to be built (and haven’t been before because the job runtime limits were
reached and the CI has terminated them (usually this happens after somewhat more than 5 hours)).</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="updating-pinnings">
<h2>Updating pinnings<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-pinnings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pinnings are updated for example when we are supporting a new version of
Python. These are versions of base packages that are supported, and form the
basis of the build string hashes at the end of conda package names. A recent
example is updating pinnings to support Python 3.10.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Update <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-utils/blob/master/bioconda_utils/bioconda_utils-conda_build_config.yaml">bioconda pinnings</a>.
This may take a few tries; you may need to make changes to match
conda-forge’s pinnings. Merge these changes into the master branch of
bioconda-utils (which will create or update a Release Please PR) and merge
in the Release Please PR to create a new version of bioconda-utils.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow autobump to pick up the new version and create a PR in
bioconda-recipes for the new version of bioconda-utils. This usually takes
an hour. Then merge the corresponding PR in bioconda-recipes. You now have
a new bioconda-utils package to use which contains those pinnings.</p></li>
<li><p>Update <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">common.sh</span></code> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-common/blob/master/common.sh">here</a>) <strong>only on the bulk
branch in bioconda-commont</strong>, to match the newly-updated bioconda-utils
version. Changing the pinnings will likely trigger many recipes to require
rebuilding. Since the bioconda-recipes/bulk branch reads from the
bioconda-common/bulk branch, this allows bulk to run a different version of
bioconda-utils. Once a bulk migration is complete, you can update the master
branch of bioconda-common.</p></li>
<li><p>In bioconda-recipes, merge master into bulk to start with a clean slate.
Since bulk is infrequently updated, there may be substantial conflicts
caused by running the default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">bulk</span> <span class="pre">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span> <span class="pre">master</span></code>.
This tends to happen most with build numbers. But since we want to prefer
using whatever is in the master branch, we can merge master into bulk, while
preferring master version in any conflicts, with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>bulk
git<span class="w"> </span>merge<span class="w"> </span>master<span class="w"> </span>-s<span class="w"> </span>recursive<span class="w"> </span>-X<span class="w"> </span>theirs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There may be a few remaining conflicts to fix; in all cases you should
prefer what’s on the master branch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-utils</span> <span class="pre">update-pinnings</span></code> in
the bulk branch. This will go through all the pinnings, figure out what
recipes they’re used with, and bump the recipes’ build numbers
appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, <strong>bulk-commit</strong> and push the changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the CI run has finished, inspect all build failures (see <a class="reference internal" href="#handling-build-failues"><span class="std std-ref">Handling build failures</span></a>).
For each failure, decide whether the recipe shall be skiplisted or whether you would like to fix it.
In general it is advisable to fix all libraries on which many recipes depend and anything else
that is obvious and easy. For the rest, mark the recipes as skiplisted in the build failure file.
It will be ignored by subsequent CI runs and put into a table in the bioconda-recipes wiki.
This strategy is good because the bulk branch update should be performed as fast as possible to avoid
redundant work between master and bulk. Also, skiplisting democratizes the update effort.</p></li>
<li><p>If no untreated failure remains, <strong>bulk-commit</strong> (see above) and push the changes and visit
step 6-7 again. If the run has finished without any build failure and did not time out before checking all
recipes, you can go on with step 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all the packages have either been successfully built or skiplisted, merge in the master branch
(after doing a git pull on it).
Usually, conflicts can occur here due to build-numbers having been increased in the master branch while you
did your changes in bulk. For such cases (which should be not so many) you can just increase the build number to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max(build_number_master,</span> <span class="pre">build_number_bulk)</span></code> and <strong>bulk-commit</strong> all of those in a row.
Repeat this until master is merged without any conflicts.
Ensure that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-common/blob/master/common.sh">bioconda-common/common.sh</a> points to the same version of
bioconda-utils that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bulk</span></code> branch has been using. Then, merge bulk into master and push the changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Shortly afterwards, you will find all remaining build failures in the</p></li>

<div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/wiki/build-failures">bioconda-recipes wiki</a>.
You can let your colleagues and the community know about the updated build failure table and ask for help.
In addition, any automatic or manual updates to recipes on this list that succeed will automatically
remove them from this list over time.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<section id="handling-build-failures">
<span id="handling-build-failues"></span><h3>Handling build failures<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-build-failures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Build failures are stored in a file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build_failure.&lt;arch&gt;.yaml</span></code> next to each failing recipe.
You can list all build failures stored in the current branch of bioconda-recipes via the command
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-utils</span> <span class="pre">list-build-failures</span> <span class="pre">recipes</span> <span class="pre">config.yaml</span></code>. The presented table will be sorted by
the number of dependencies and package downloads, which should help for prioritizing the fixing work.</p>
<p>This file can look e.g. like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">recipe_sha</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">37fa4d78a2ee8b18065a0bd0f594ad1e9587bb4ac7edf1b4629a9f10fa45d0a5</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># The shas256 hash of the recipe at which it failed to build.</span>
<span class="nt">skiplist</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># Set to true to skiplist this recipe so that it will be ignored as long as its latest commit is the one given above.</span>
<span class="nt">log</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">|2-</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="no">&lt;the logging output of the failed build&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Based on the log, you can decide whether and how the recipe can be fixed or whether it shall be skiplisted for
fixing it later in the future.
Notably, any update to the recipe automatically de-skiplists it, because the skiplist
entry is only valid together with the hash listed in the first line.</p>
<p>It is possible to further annotate and even manually create build failure records via the <a class="conda-package reference internal" href="../recipes/bioconda-utils/README.html#package-bioconda-utils" title="bioconda-utils package"><code class="xref any conda conda-package docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bioconda-utils</span></code></a> CLI.
Check out all possibilities in the corresponding help message:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bioconda-utils<span class="w"> </span>annotate-build-failure<span class="w"> </span>--help
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Skiplisted recipes from the master branch are automatically displayed in a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/wiki/build-failures">wiki page</a>,
so that others can pick them up for providing a fix.</p>

<section id="updating-bioconductor">
<h2>Updating Bioconductor<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-bioconductor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bioconductor gets updated twice a year (spring and fall), where all BioC
packages get released with updated versions at the same time. This in turn
requires updating the packages on Bioconda. This is a perfect use-case for the
bulk branch. The process is generally the same as above but without the
pinnings updates and with some Bioconductor-specific helper scripts.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Execute step 4 from above.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the latest BioConductor version, and update all BioConductor
recipes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>bioconda-utils<span class="w"> </span>bioconductor-skeleton<span class="w"> </span>update-all-packages<span class="w"> </span>--bioc-version<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$BIOC_VERSION</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Execute step 6 from above.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute step 7 from above.
Alternatively, use the
[rootNodes.py](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/scripts/bioconductor/rootNodes.py">https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/scripts/bioconductor/rootNodes.py</a>)
from the bioconda-recipes repo to help figure out what the primary root
nodes are for the currently-remaining packages to be built. This looks at
recently-built packages, removes them from the DAG of recipes to be built,
and then reports to stdout the remaining root nodes. This information can be
used to strategically edit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build-fail-blacklist</span></code> file to prioritize
the building of those root nodes. Once builds seem to be stabilizing, remove the temporary edits to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">build-fail-blacklist</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Execute step 8-10 from above.</p></li>

<section id="notes-on-working-with-bulk-branch">
<h2>Notes on working with bulk branch<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-on-working-with-bulk-branch" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some unordered notes on working with the bulk branch:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Remember that successfully-built packages are immediately pushed to Anaconda.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to coordinate the timing of fixes and pushes (say, via gitter).
This is because the bulk branch has <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fail-fast:</span> <span class="pre">false</span></code> set to allow
parallel jobs to progress as much as possible. Multiple people pushing to
bulk means that there is a risk of trying to build the same recipes multiple
times. In such a case, only the first package will be actually uploaded and
subsequent packages will a failure on the upload step. So there is no danger
to the channel, it’s just poor use of CI resources.</p></li>
<li><p>The logs are awkward to read and hard to find exactly where failures occur.
One way to do this is to go to the bottom where there is a report of which
packages failed. This report is shown when a bulk job goes to completion
(rather than timing out). Then search for that package backwards through the
log. You can also look for the broad structure of the log: recipes with
nothing to do will be reported in a short stanza, so you can use those as
structural markers to indicate where there’s no useful log info.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of using the search functionality in the CI logs, download the raw
log (from gear menu at top right) to use your browser search functionality,
which is often much easier to use (for example, Chrome shows occurrences of
search term throughout the document in the scrollbar, which makes digging for
the actual error a lot easier).</p></li>
<li><p>You may see a lot of output for Python packages in particular. This is because for
bioconda-utils to figure out whether it needs to build the package, it needs
to know what the hash is for the package. This in turn requires figuring out
all the dependencies to see which of them are pinned and then using those to
calculate a hash. So it may appear that it’s doing a lot of work for packages
that don’t need to be rebuilt, but that work needs to be done simply to
figure out if a rebuild is needed, and so this is expected.</p></li>
<li><p>The bulk runs take place on GitHub Actions, and the configuration is in
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.github/workflows/Bulk.yml</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
