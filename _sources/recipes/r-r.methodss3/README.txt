=============

|downloads|

Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods.  Major effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers.  For example, generic functions are created automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically solved, if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future may want to migrate to S4.  This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that generates standard S3 methods.
