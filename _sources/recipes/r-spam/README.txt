Set of functions for sparse matrix algebra. Differences with SparseM/Matrix are:  (1) we only support (essentially) one sparse matrix format,  (2) based on transparent and simple structure(s),  (3) tailored for MCMC calculations within GMRF.  (4) S3 and S4 like-"compatible"  ...     and it is fast.
