   Synapsis is a Bioconductor software package for automated \(unbiased and reproducible\) analysis of meiotic immunofluorescence datasets. The primary functions of the software can i\) identify cells in meiotic prophase that are labelled by a synaptonemal complex axis or central element protein\, ii\) isolate individual synaptonemal complexes and measure their physical length\, iii\) quantify foci and co\-localise them with synaptonemal complexes\, iv\) measure interference between synaptonemal complex\-associated foci. The software has applications that extend to multiple species and to the analysis of other proteins that label meiotic prophase chromosomes. The software converts meiotic immunofluorescence images into R data frames that are compatible with machine learning methods. Given a set of microscopy images of meiotic spread slides\, synapsis crops images around individual single cells\, counts colocalising foci on strands on a per cell basis\, and measures the distance between foci on any given strand.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-synapsis

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-synapsis

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-synapsis

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-synapsis:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-synapsis/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
