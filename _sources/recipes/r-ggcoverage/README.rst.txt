   The goal of \'ggcoverage\' is to simplify the process of visualizing genome coverage. It contains functions to load data from BAM\, BigWig or BedGraph files\, create genome coverage plot\, add various annotations to the coverage plot\, including base and amino acid annotation\, GC annotation\, gene annotation\, transcript annotation\, ideogram annotation and peak annotation.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install r-ggcoverage

   and update with::

      mamba update r-ggcoverage

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname r-ggcoverage

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/r-ggcoverage:<tag>

   (see `r-ggcoverage/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
