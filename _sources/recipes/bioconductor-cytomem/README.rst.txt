   Marker Enrichment Modeling \(MEM\)

   :homepage: https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.20/bioc/html/cytoMEM.html
   :license: GPL-3
   :recipe: /`bioconductor-cytomem <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-cytomem>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-cytomem/meta.yaml>`_

   MEM\, Marker Enrichment Modeling\, automatically generates and displays quantitative labels for cell populations that have been identified from single\-cell data. The input for MEM is a dataset that has pre\-clustered or pre\-gated populations with cells in rows and features in columns. Labels convey a list of measured features and the features\' levels of relative enrichment on each population. MEM can be applied to a wide variety of data types and can compare between MEM labels from flow cytometry\, mass cytometry\, single cell RNA\-seq\, and spectral flow cytometry using RMSD.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-cytomem

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-cytomem

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-cytomem

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-cytomem:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-cytomem/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
