 Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers  that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are  available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters  and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions. Many fast  algorithmic operations such as 'match' and 'order' support interactive data exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.
