   :links: doi: :doi:`10.1038/s41436-020-0749-x`

   SCRAMble identifies clusters of soft clipped reads in a BAM file\, builds consensus sequences\,
   aligns to representative L1Ta\, AluYa5\, and SVA\-E sequences\, and outputs MEI calls

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install scramble

   and update with::

      mamba update scramble

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname scramble

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/scramble:<tag>

   (see `scramble/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)

Notes
-----
SCRAMble runs as a two\-step process. First cluster\_identifier is used to generate soft\-clipped
read cluster consensus sequences. Second\, SCRAMble.R analyzes the cluster file for likely MEIs.
Custom wrapper script scramble.sh is provided to help setting location of SCRAMble.R script\,
and values for \-\-install\-dir and \-\-mei\-refs params.
