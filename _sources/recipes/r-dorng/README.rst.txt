This package provides functions to perform reproducible parallel foreach loops, using independent random streams as generated by L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive generator [L'Ecuyer (1999)]. It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops into fully reproducible loops, independently of the number of workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
