   ExtractAdaptersFastqc reads which adapter sequences where found from a FastQC raw report.
   These sequences can be used as input for a QC tool such as cutadapt.
   The sequences can be output in plain text format with a
   newline character as a separator between the sequences.
   Alternatively the sequences can be output in FASTA format.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install biopet-extractadaptersfastqc

   and update with::

      mamba update biopet-extractadaptersfastqc

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname biopet-extractadaptersfastqc

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/biopet-extractadaptersfastqc:<tag>

   (see `biopet-extractadaptersfastqc/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)

Notes
-----
biopet\-extractadaptersfastqc is a Java program that comes with a custom wrapper shell script. By default \'no default java option\' is set in the wrapper. The command that runs the program is \'biopet\-extractadaptersfastqc\'. If you want to overwrite it you can specify memory options directly after your binaries. If you have \_JAVA\_OPTIONS set globally this will take precedence. For example run it with \'biopet\-extractadaptersfastqc \-Xms512m \-Xmx1g\'.
