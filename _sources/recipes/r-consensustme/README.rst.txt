   ConsensusTME is a consensus based approach to generating cancer specific gene sets for multiple cell types found within the tumour microenvironment. This package allows access to these genesets and provides a wrapper for using these gene sets with various statistical frameworks to generate normalised enrichment scores. These can be used to identify relative quantities of cell types across multiple samples.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install r-consensustme

   and update with::

      mamba update r-consensustme

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname r-consensustme

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/r-consensustme:<tag>

   (see `r-consensustme/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
