   ChExMix aims to characterize protein\-DNA binding subtypes in ChIP\-exo experiments. ChExMix assumes that different regulatory complexes will result in different protein\-DNA crosslinking signatures in ChIP\-exo data\, and thus analysis of ChIP\-exo sequencing tag patterns should enable detection of multiple protein\-DNA binding modes for a given regulatory protein. ChExMix uses a mixture modeling framework to probabilistically model the genomic locations and subtype membership of protein\-DNA binding events\, leveraging both ChIP\-exo tag enrichment patterns and DNA sequence information. In doing so\, ChExMix offers a more principled and robust approach to characterizing binding subtypes than simply clustering binding events using motif information.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install chexmix

   and update with::

      mamba update chexmix

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname chexmix

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/chexmix:<tag>

   (see `chexmix/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
