   An experimentdata package to supplement the preciseTAD package containing pre\-trained models and the variable importances of each genomic annotation used to build the model parsed into list objects and available in ExperimentHub. In total\, preciseTADhub provides access to n\=84 random forest classification models optimized to predict TAD\/chromatin loop boundary regions and stored as .RDS files. The value\, n\, comes from the fact that we considered l\=2 cell lines \{GM12878\, K562\}\, g\=2 ground truth boundaries \{Arrowhead\, Peakachu\}\, and c\=21 autosomal chromosomes \{CHR1\, CHR2\, ...\, CHR22\} \(omitting CHR9\). Furthermore\, each object is itself a two\-item list containing\: \(1\) the model object\, and \(2\) the variable importances for CTCF\, RAD21\, SMC3\, and ZNF143 used to predict boundary regions. Each model is trained via a \"holdout\" strategy\, in which data from chromosomes \{CHR1\, CHR2\, ...\, CHRi\-1\, CHRi\+1\, ...\, CHR22\} were used to build the model and the ith chromosome was reserved for testing. See https\:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2020.09.03.282186 for more detail on the model building strategy.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-precisetadhub

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-precisetadhub

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-precisetadhub

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-precisetadhub:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-precisetadhub/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
