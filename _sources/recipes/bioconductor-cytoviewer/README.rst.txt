   An interactive multi\-channel image viewer for R

   :homepage: https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.20/bioc/html/cytoviewer.html
   :license: GPL-3
   :recipe: /`bioconductor-cytoviewer <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-cytoviewer>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-cytoviewer/meta.yaml>`_

   This R package supports interactive visualization of multi\-channel images and segmentation masks generated by imaging mass cytometry and other highly multiplexed imaging techniques using shiny. The cytoviewer interface is divided into image\-level \(Composite and Channels\) and cell\-level visualization \(Masks\). It allows users to overlay individual images with segmentation masks\, integrates well with SingleCellExperiment and SpatialExperiment objects for metadata visualization and supports image downloads.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-cytoviewer

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-cytoviewer

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-cytoviewer

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-cytoviewer:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-cytoviewer/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
