   :recipe: /`beacon2-ri-tools <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/beacon2-ri-tools>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/beacon2-ri-tools/meta.yaml>`_

   Beacon2 RI Tools v2 is a software created with the main goal of generating BFF data from .csv or .vcf \(and probably more types of datafiles in the future\). This is based on the first beacon ri tools. Currently\, the supported input formats are VCF\, CSV\, and Phenopackets. These formats are converted to BFF \(Beacon Friendly Format JSON\, following Beacon v2 official specifications\) and inserted into a Beacon database.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install beacon2-ri-tools

   and update with::

      mamba update beacon2-ri-tools

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname beacon2-ri-tools

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/beacon2-ri-tools:<tag>

   (see `beacon2-ri-tools/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
