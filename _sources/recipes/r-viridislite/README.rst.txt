=============

|downloads|

Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -, 'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib' <http://matplotlib.org/ > is a popular plotting library for 'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness. This is the 'lite' version of the more complete 'viridis' package that can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
