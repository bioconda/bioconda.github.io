   Single cell Higher Order Testing \(scHOT\) is an R package that facilitates testing changes in higher order structure of gene expression along either a developmental trajectory or across space. scHOT is general and modular in nature\, can be run in multiple data contexts such as along a continuous trajectory\, between discrete groups\, and over spatial orientations\; as well as accommodate any higher order measurement such as variability or correlation. scHOT meaningfully adds to first order effect testing\, such as differential expression\, and provides a framework for interrogating higher order interactions from single cell data.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-schot

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-schot

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-schot

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-schot:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-schot/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
