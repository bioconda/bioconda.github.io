   R implementation of Information measures

   :homepage: https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.17/bioc/html/Informeasure.html
   :license: GPL-3
   :recipe: /`bioconductor-informeasure <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-informeasure>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-informeasure/meta.yaml>`_

   This package compiles most of the information measures currently available\: mutual information\, conditional mutual information\, interaction information\, partial information decomposition and part mutual information. All of these estimators can be used to quantify nonlinear dependence between variables in \(biological regulatory\) network inference. The first estimator is used to infer bivariate networks while the last four estimators are dedicated to analysis of trivariate networks.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-informeasure

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-informeasure

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-informeasure

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-informeasure:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-informeasure/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
