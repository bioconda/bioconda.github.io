   psytrans.py \- Parasite \& Symbiont Transcriptome Separation

   :homepage: https://github.com/rivera10/psytrans
   :license: GPLv3
   :recipe: /`psytrans <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/psytrans>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/psytrans/meta.yaml>`_

   psytrans.py separates the sequences of a host species from those of its main symbiont\(s\) or parasite\(s\) based on Support Vector Machine classification.
   The program takes as input a file in fasta format with the sequences to be classified.
   The program also requires a file with sequences of a species related to the host\, and a file with sequences related to the symbiont \(or parasite\).
   The queries will be compared to these two files using BLASTX.
   Alternatively\, the user can provide the output of pre\-computed BLASTX searches \(in tabular format\: \-outfmt 6 or 7\).
   The classification is then carried out using the command line tools from libsvm.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install psytrans

   and update with::

      mamba update psytrans

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname psytrans

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/psytrans:<tag>

   (see `psytrans/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
