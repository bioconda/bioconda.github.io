   An approach to filter out and\/or identify phytoplankton cells from all particles measured via flow cytometry pigment and cell complexity information. It does this using a sequence of one\-dimensional gates on pre\-defined channels measuring certain pigmentation and complexity. The package is especially tuned for cyanobacteria\, but will work fine for phytoplankton communities where there is at least one cell characteristic that differentiates every phytoplankton in the community.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-cyanofilter

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-cyanofilter

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-cyanofilter

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-cyanofilter:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-cyanofilter/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
