Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of huge  amounts of information. Here the circlize package provides an implementation  of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available  software. The flexibility of this package is based on the usage of low-level  graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily  implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless  connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R,  circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for  better understanding complex patterns behind multi-dimensional data.
