   Deep characterization of cancer drugs

   :homepage: https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.20/bioc/html/DeepTarget.html
   :license: GPL-2
   :recipe: /`bioconductor-deeptarget <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-deeptarget>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-deeptarget/meta.yaml>`_

   This package predicts a drugâ€™s primary target\(s\) or secondary target\(s\) by integrating large\-scale genetic and drug screens from the Cancer Dependency Map project run by the Broad Institute. It further investigates whether the drug specifically targets the wild\-type or mutated target forms. To show how to use this package in practice\, we provided sample data along with step\-by\-step example.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-deeptarget

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-deeptarget

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-deeptarget

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-deeptarget:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-deeptarget/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
