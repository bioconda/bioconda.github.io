   NOn\-Linear rigid Block NMA approach \(NOLB\) is a conceptually simple and computationally efficient method for non\-linear normal mode analysis.

   The key observation of the method is that the angular velocity of a residue can be interpreted as the result of an implicit force\, such that the motion of the residue can be considered as a pure rotation about a certain center.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install nolb

   and update with::

      mamba update nolb

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname nolb

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/nolb:<tag>

   (see `nolb/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
