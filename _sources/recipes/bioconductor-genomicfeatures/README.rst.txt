bioconductor-genomicfeatures
============================

|downloads|

A set of tools and methods for making and manipulating transcript centric annotations. With these tools the user can easily download the genomic locations of the transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either the UCSC Genome Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported in the future). This information is then stored in a local database that keeps track of the relationship between transcripts, exons, cds and genes. Flexible methods are provided for extracting the desired features in a convenient format.
