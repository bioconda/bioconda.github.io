   From functional enrichment results to biological networks

   :homepage: https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.18/bioc/html/enrichViewNet.html
   :license: Artistic-2.0
   :recipe: /`bioconductor-enrichviewnet <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-enrichviewnet>`_/`meta.yaml <https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/tree/master/recipes/bioconductor-enrichviewnet/meta.yaml>`_

   This package enables the visualization of functional enrichment results as network graphs. First the package enables the visualization of enrichment results\, in a format corresponding to the one generated by gprofiler2\, as a customizable Cytoscape network. In those networks\, both gene datasets \(GO terms\/pathways\/protein complexes\) and genes associated to the datasets are represented as nodes. While the edges connect each gene to its dataset\(s\). The package also provides the option to create enrichment maps from functional enrichment results. Enrichment maps enable the visualization of enriched terms into a network with edges connecting overlapping genes.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install bioconductor-enrichviewnet

   and update with::

      mamba update bioconductor-enrichviewnet

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname bioconductor-enrichviewnet

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconductor-enrichviewnet:<tag>

   (see `bioconductor-enrichviewnet/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
