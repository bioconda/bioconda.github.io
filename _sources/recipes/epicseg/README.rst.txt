   EpiCSeg \(Epigenome Count\-based Segmentation\) is a software for annotating the genome based on the state of the chromatin. It provides tools for extracting count data from BAM files\, typlically corresponding to ChIP\-seq experiments for histone marks \(but other choices are possible\) it learns a statistical model for the read counts based on a HMM\, it annotates the genome\, and it provides tools for displaying and analyzing the obtained models and segmentations. EpiCSeg can be used as an R package or from the command line via Rscript.

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install epicseg

   and update with::

      mamba update epicseg

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname epicseg

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/epicseg:<tag>

   (see `epicseg/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
