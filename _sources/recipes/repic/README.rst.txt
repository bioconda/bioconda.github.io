   REliable PIcking by Consensus \(REPIC\) is an ensemble learning approach to cryogenic\-electron microscopy \(cryo\-EM\) particle picking. It identifies particles common to multiple picked particle sets \(i.e.\, consensus particles\) using graph theory and integer linear programming \(ILP\). Picked particle sets may be found by a human specialist \(manual\)\, template matching\, mathematical function \(e.g.\, RELION\'s Laplacian\-of\-Gaussian auto\-picking\)\, or machine\-learning method. REPIC expects particle sets to be in BOX file format \(\*.box\) where each particle has coordinates\, a detection box size \(in pixels\)\, and \(optional\) a score \[0\-1\].

   .. rubric:: Installation

  You need a conda-compatible package manager
  (currently either `micromamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_, or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda>`_)
  and the Bioconda channel already activated (see :ref:`set-up-channels`).

  While any of above package managers is fine, it is currently recommended to use either
  micromamba or mamba (see `here <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions).
  We will show all commands using mamba below, but the arguments are the same for the two
  others.

  Given that you already have a conda environment in which you want to have this package, install with::

      mamba install repic

   and update with::

      mamba update repic

  To create a new environment, run::

      mamba create --name myenvname repic

  with ``myenvname`` being a reasonable name for the environment
  (see e.g. the `mamba docs <https://mamba.readthedocs.io>`_ for details and further options).

  Alternatively, use the docker container::

      docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/repic:<tag>

   (see `repic/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
